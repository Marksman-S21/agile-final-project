# Agile-final-project
## Agile-final-project for Honorary Certification 

> As a learner, in Coursera, currently enrolling the DevOps Software Engineering course, I will do the final project,from the Agile and Scrum training 

### Expectation

***In this project, i will create an Agile plan with ZenHub. I will write user stories, build and refine the product backlog, build a sprint plan, move stories on the kanban board, set up a burndown chart, and get ready for the next sprint.***

### FINAL PROJECT SCENARIOâ€¯ 

In this scenario, i will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, i will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, i will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, i will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. And the most important i will practice what i have learned.
